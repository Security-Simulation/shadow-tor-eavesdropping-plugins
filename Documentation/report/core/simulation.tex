\section{Simulation}
\label{sec:simulation}
In order to analyze the effectiveness of a time analysis attack in a
realistic scenario, we decide to consider a simulation environment.
We wanted to model the scenario in a way that most of the
characteristics of the Tor network architecture would have been
considered.

The shadow simulator seemed to be a good candidate for our purpose. In
the next paragraphs we will introduce shadow and we will illustrate our
work based on this simulator.
