In this document we present an introduction about the main
characteristics
of the Tor network and the Tor vulnerabilities at the state of the
art. In particular we focused our attention on the timing analysis attack,
inspecting its feasibility and efficiency. For this reason we built a
set of software tools that we used within the Shadow simulator in order to 
simulate a timing analysis attack. Then we conducted a series
of simulation experiments, analyzed the results which mostly confirmed our
initial expectations and at the end we proposed some Tor alternatives present in
literature like Astoria, which proposes different policies in the Onion
Routing path creation.
