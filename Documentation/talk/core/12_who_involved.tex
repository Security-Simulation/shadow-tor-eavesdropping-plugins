	\frametitle{Surveillance}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Some intelligence organizations obviously do
		anti-terrorist researches and checks (and that's good!).
		\item Some intelligence organizations do that in wrong ways, a
		normal guy searched "Pressure cooking" and "knap sack" on google and
		FBI knocked at his house.
	\end{itemize}

\subsection{Obscuring}

	\frametitle{GEO-Obscuration}

	east places like china or japan).}\\

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{SOPA and PIPA}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Stop Online Piracy Act
		\item Gives the control of the obscuration of a site to the
		proprietary of the copyright (!) and to the government (!!!).
		\item In other words...everyone could obscure every site, that
		use copyrighted contents, from every search engine!
		\item Legal penalities and fees to the source of the publication.
		\item Incompatible with DMCA, GPL, etc...
		\item \textbf{Incompatible with VPN, ORs, proxies, etc (!!!).}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Companies}
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Focused ADv}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Some companies can do some users profilation.
		\item What you've searched, what you say or what you do can be a
		gold information on who you are and what you're going to do.
		\item Maybe the company inform you, and you have nothing to
		hide, but, you really want to say to a company sensible data?
		\item Imagine if a data leakage occurs and someone learns about
		your google searches...
		\item Coff, Coff, Windows 10 keylogger...
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Bad Guys}
%(identity stealing, money stealing, etc.)
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Not only powerful adversaries}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Obviously the companies are not the only person interested
		in our real identity, someone could gain my IP, and/or my
		geolocation to break into my
		house when I'm out.
		\item So we must ensure our anonymity, just to have a form of
		security in addition to the classical ones.
		\item On the other hand, there is the identity stealing.
	\end{itemize}
