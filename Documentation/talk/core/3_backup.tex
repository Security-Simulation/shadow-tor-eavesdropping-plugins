	\begin{itemize}
		\item Alice pick a random number $a$, a prime number $p$ and
		$\alpha$ as a primitive root of p.
		\item Alice calculate $k_a = \alpha ^{a} mod p$ and sends $<k_a,
		p, \alpha>$ over the channel.
		\item Bob read the packet, pick a random number $b$,
		calculate $k_b = \alpha^{b} mod p$ and sends it to Alice.
	\end{itemize}
	Now the shared key $K = k_b^{a} = k_a^{b} = \alpha^{ab} mod p$ is known
	to Alice and Bob\footnote{For the little Fermat theorem ($a^p \equiv a$
	$mod p$) if p is a prime}.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item If a key is derived from another with a deterministic
		method then a leak of the second key can reveal every
		eavesdropped transmission encrypthed with the first key.
		\item The immunity to this kind of attacks is called
		\textit{Perfect Forward Security}.
		\item Used in Diffie Hellman based TLS, OTR, etc.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item A file is encrypthed with his hash and shared over the
		network.
		\item It can optionally encrypthed with the public keys of the
		dark net users (pseudonym-like) (and signed).
		\item The file is so splitted in chunks and shared over the
		network.
		\item Every node can't understand which chunk of which file is
		processing and what is written in the file itself.

		\item The net is garanted to resemble a small world network (so the max degree is
		$log(n)$) using the Metropolis Hasting algorithm.
		\item If a file is not popular and only a chunk is lost, the
		file is lost forever.
