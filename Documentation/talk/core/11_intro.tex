	Privacy is the right to publish only some informations that we want to
	publish.\\

	There are a lot of laws and legal issues related to privacy (but some
	people are just not interested in laws).

	\frametitle {Anonymity}
	We will talk about anonymity as the propriety of disconnect the user of a
	service from some basic proprieties:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Geolocation.
		\item Association to a face or a name (or to an IP address).
	\end{itemize}

	Sometimes we need to re-associate the user with a communication
	channel or so.
