	\frametitle {Anonymity}
	We will talk about anonimy as the propriety of disconnect the user of a
	service from some basic proprieties:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Geolocation.
		\item Association to a face or a name (or to an IP address).
	\end{itemize}

	Sometimes we need to reassociate the user with a communication
	channel or so.
